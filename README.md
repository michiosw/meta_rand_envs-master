# meta_rand_envs
Environments for non-stationary meta-RL problems

This repository contains the environments investigated in the masterthesis `Meta-Reinforcement Learning in Non-Stationary and Dynamic Environments`.
Its current main usage is supporting the implementation of the `Continuous Environment Meta-Reinforcement Learning (CEMRL)`
algorithm (see [CEMRL](https://github.com/LerchD/cemrl_thesis)).
This repository is inspired by [rand_param_envs](https://github.com/dennisl88/rand_param_envs).

--------------------------------------

## Installation
Follow the installation instructions from the [CEMRL](https://github.com/LerchD/cemrl_thesis) repository.

## MISC
- Most environments are based on parent classes in `meta_rand_envs/base.py`
- Environments not actively used in the CEMRL implementation are deprecated and might not work.
